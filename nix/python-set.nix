# A pyproject.nix *builders* package set, sourcing every third-party
# dependency from nixpkgs rather than from a lock file.
#
# Ported from nanopynix, which wrote all of the findings below. Lillecarl/pymux#319.
#
# Why the builders at all: nixpkgs' Python infrastructure works by dependency
# propagation, and `withPackages` keeps only derivations that are importable
# modules. A `buildPythonApplication` is therefore dropped from an environment
# *together with everything it propagates* -- which is why `pymux` cannot be in
# its own test environment, and why `pymux/nix/checks.nix` repeats by hand the
# dependency list `pymux/default.nix` already declares. pyproject.nix's builders
# put runtime dependencies in `passthru` instead and assemble real virtualenvs,
# so there is no propagation to fall off and no module/application distinction
# to be caught by. One site-packages also means nothing to shadow, which is
# Lillecarl/pymux#318.
#
# Why not uv2nix: the builders are written for lock-file consumers, and
# `pyproject-nix.build.packages` is by its own documentation "incomplete, and
# much smaller in both package count and scope than nixpkgs". Adopting a
# `uv.lock` would move every third-party dependency from nixpkgs to PyPI,
# including the native ones nixpkgs already builds correctly for us. So instead
# the set is populated *from* nixpkgs, via `hacks.nixpkgsPrebuilt`.
#
# What makes that affordable is `closure` below. `nixpkgsPrebuilt` normally
# takes its `passthru.dependencies` from a lock-file-derived `prev`; with no
# lock file there is no `prev`, and writing that metadata by hand for a
# transitive closure of this size would be its own maintenance burden. But
# nixpkgs already records exactly that relation, in `propagatedBuildInputs` --
# the very mechanism being replaced. So the closure is walked and the metadata
# derived from it, and adding a dependency to a pyproject.toml needs no edit
# here.

  /*
    Lift one already-built nixpkgs Python package into a pyproject.nix
    builders set, deriving its runtime dependency metadata from the
    propagated inputs nixpkgs already recorded.

    `quiet` is set because the ABI warning it suppresses compares the
    interpreter of `from` against the one behind `prev`'s pyprojectHook --
    and `prev` here is a bare metadata attrset with no hook, so there is
    nothing to compare. `nixpkgsPrebuilt` reacts to that by setting its
    internal `python` to `null` (`build/hacks/default.nix:75`), which
    disables not just the warning but also the hard version check on the
    line below it. So both are reinstated here against `python` directly:
    a lifted package's `.so` files are linked against *its own*
    interpreter's ABI, and a silent mismatch shows up as an import error
    deep inside a venv rather than as an evaluation failure.

    The `installPhase` addendum is what makes a lifted package usable as a
    *build system* and not only as a runtime dependency. pyproject.nix
    assembles a build backend's `sys.path` from `NIX_PYPROJECT_PYTHONPATH`
    (`build/hooks/pyproject-build-hook.sh:15`), and each package contributes
    itself to that variable from its own `$out/nix-support/setup-hook`,
    written by `pyprojectOutputSetupHook`
    (`build/hooks/pyproject-output-setup-hook.sh:1-7`). `nixpkgsPrebuilt`
    never runs that hook -- its derivation carries no `pyprojectHook`
    (`build/hacks/default.nix:84-100`) and `write-nixpkgs-prebuilt.py`
    copies `nix-support` verbatim minus `propagated-build-inputs`
    (`write-nixpkgs-prebuilt.py:29-38`), and a nixpkgs Python package has
    nothing else in there. So a lifted package lands in `nativeBuildInputs`,
    contributes nothing to the search path, and the backend fails to import.
    Writing the same line `pyprojectOutputSetupHook` would have written fixes
    it.

    The nixpkgs packages a set of our own projects depend on, read out of
    their pyproject.toml files.

    Used to seed `mkPythonSet`'s `nixpkgsRoots`. The obvious alternative --
    asking the previously nixpkgs-built copies of our projects for their
    `propagatedBuildInputs` -- is circular once those projects are built by
    the builders set instead, and would also mean the roots were derived from
    a build we are in the middle of replacing. Reading the declarations is
    both acyclic and closer to the truth.

    **`exclude` has to name every source of this collection that the set
    supplies, and the default cannot do it here.** nanopynix could take the
    directory names, because its projects are directories of one repository.
    Ours are separate sources, and a `projectRoot` is a store path named
    `<hash>-source` under the lock, so `baseNameOf` says nothing. An
    unexcluded name is worse than an error: nixpkgs has a `pyte` and a
    `prompt-toolkit` of its own, so the lookup would succeed and lift
    upstream's package under the name our overlay means to supply.

    **PEP 508 markers are evaluated, against the same environment the
    renderer uses.** A declaration can be conditional -- ptyhost asks for
    `yawinpty` on Windows, where there is no pty to run a program on -- and
    such a name has no nixpkgs package to resolve to on this platform.
    Reading the names without the markers turned that into a build error for
    a dependency nothing here will ever install.

    Everything remaining is resolved against `python.pkgs`, which is where a
    name is expected to be resolvable -- an unresolvable one is a real error
    and says so, rather than being silently dropped and reappearing as an
    import failure inside a venv.
